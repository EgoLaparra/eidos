# The government promotes improved cultivar to boost agricultural production for ensuring food security.
# However, the policy to seriously cut down the use of inorganic fertilizer and phase out the fertilizer subsidy results in deteriorating biophysical conditions, less use of inorganic fertilizer, less water, significantly reduced farm sizes which lead to low benefit from the improved cultivar.
